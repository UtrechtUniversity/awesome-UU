The list can be your starting point to find interesting UU projects, and get inpired and learn from other projects. Is your project also \"awesome\"? Add it to this list (see Contributing ). \"The purpose of this list is to have a collection of projects using Git version control, that score high on openness, reusability, and transparency in order to showcase good examples of open practices. In the context of this, awesome refers to projects that showcase the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) and Open Science spirit. This is for example shown in repositories that have a license that permits reuse and a README file with clear documentation. In order to promote open science, Utrecht University has introduced the Open Science Programme . Beside topics like Open access , Public engagement , and Recognition and rewards , there is a strong focus on FAIR Data and Software . This awesome list was created by efforts of the track of FAIR Data and Software to help researchers to find good examples. We believe that learning by example is very useful in the field of Open Science and FAIR Data and Software.\" FAIR Data and Software team \u2763\ufe0f We are looking for Utrecht University researchers that are interested in helping to maintain this list.

Add project to this list Do you know about a project that should be in the Awesome Utrecht University list? This could be your own project or a project of one of your colleagues. We would love to hear about that project! The contribution guidelines help you to propose a new project to the list. Background What is an Awesome list? \"Awesome lists\" are curated lists of awesome stuff. The lists are very popular in the field of open source development (see https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Read \"The awesome manifesto\" for more information about awesome lists. Initial project collection The initial collection of projects was made based on the collected repositories from the SWORDS-UU project (more information follows soon). Repositories were considered when they have a license and 25 stars or fulfill 4/5 FAIR criteria. Implementing Awesome lists for your university We encourage other universities to also implement awesome lists for their research. You can fork this repository as a starting point. Having such a list is a useful resource to showcase good projects that have been conducted or are still ongoing and helps promoting the open science approach. If you need help getting started please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We will gladly assist you. Contact This awesome list was created by efforts of the FAIR Data and Software team of Utrecht University. If you have any question or remark about this list, do not hesitate to contact Keven Quach and Jonathan de Bruin via mail or open an issue on GitHub. Are you a Utrecht University researcher looking for support on making your research code and data open and FAIR? Or do you want to brainstorm about these topics?
